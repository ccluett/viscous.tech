{% include figure.html img="Picture1.png" width="100%" caption="There are two main components of drag an underwater vehicle experiences as it moves through the water: pressure drag and viscous drag. When a body is bluff, total drag is dominated by pressure drag. When a body is streamlined, total drag is dominated by viscous drag. For an equal frontal area, a streamlined body will always have less drag than a bluff body." %}
