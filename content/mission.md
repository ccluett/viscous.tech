## Mission

Our mission is to decarbonize marine transport and have a global impact on greenhouse gas emission reduction by building sustainable technologies. We want to be at the forefront of innovative engineering for clean energy solutions, coalescing a group of talented, multi-disciplinary engineers to work on the world’s most pressing problems. Our mission may be ambitious, but confronting existential crises demands audacious solutions. By using a first principles approach and creating strategic partnerships, we believe we can develop large-scale carbon reduction solutions in a pragmatic way.

## Approach

We intend to use the engineering talent our company was founded upon to apply a systems engineering methodology to solve complex problems related to reducing carbon emissions. By first decomposing hard to solve problems into parts, we can identify a root cause, develop a solution space, and systematically drive towards the best solution. We don’t tie ourselves to one specific technology or way of doing things – rather, we use our diverse engineering experiences, skills, knowledge, and resources to problem solve and innovate the most practical and scalable solutions. 
Where practical, we integrate existing technologies into purpose-built integrated solutions. Where required, we develop and build our own technologies from the ground-up. Technology we integrate today may be technology we build better ourselves tomorrow.

## Strategy

Our strategy is to first develop demonstrator solutions for the maritime industry while simultaneously developing industry partners who recognize the need to reduce their carbon emissions. By forming industry partnerships, a direct pathway develops to impact an existing market with sustainable technologies. From the start we plan to engage regulatory bodies to helpful inform and be part of the discourse with regards to decarbonization strategy and policy.
